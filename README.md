Description of Storyboards:
The idea here is to let the user browse for artists similar to artists
they already like, but potentially in different decades. 
This would both allow for a nifty visualization of music history (such
as seeing clusters of bands of a certain type coming in in a wave) and
useful exploration of bands a viewer might be interested in trying.
Along these lines, we wanted a simple way to pivot the search to allow
the user to go through a chain of artists, looking at similar artists
for each one, without doing much work. So, just by clicking on an
artist they can pivot the search to focus on this new artist.
We also wanted to give the user an easy way to listen to the artists
they found, so some kind of link-to-music would be handy.
The idea was to start with one artist and then step away from that
artist along the similarity graph, showing each link with a line
between the source artist and the similarity.

Description of the Final Visualization:
The final visualization shows the selected artist and related artists,
"sorted" by decade, with the artist placed at the center of their
career's timeline and lines stretching out to indicate when they
started and stopped making music.
Hovering over an artist displays a tooltip with a few details and a
list of songs, one per year they released an album. These songs are
links to youtube queries, so clicking on one should take you to a list
of youtube videos containing the song.
Finally, we allow the user to sort the similar artists vertically by
either familiarity or hotttnesss, both scores calculated by the
dataset creators.

Changes:
The original storyboard did not include the career span of the
artists. We thought this would be a more interesting view, and allow
users to better understand the data and get a better feel for which
bands were really long lasting and which were only 1 (or a few) hit
wonders. 
Additionally, we discarded the idea of lines linking the artists, both
to allow showing the date range with lines and to avoid the clutter
that it would introduce. Furthermore, because of the large number of
similar artists contained by the dataset, it became unnecessary to do
multiple steps along the similarity graph, an so the lines would have
just been one line between each artist and the selected artist, which
would have been pointless.
We also removed the ability to select decades to view. For one reason,
the graph was clear enough even with all decades shown all the time
and the X axis was not the limiting factor in the
visualization.

Development Process:
{Paul} I wrote all of the visualization front-end from sending the
queries to the python back-end to drawing the D3/SVG objects and user
interface buttons. I also produced the storyboard. I would say I
worked approximately 28 hours on this assignment. I would say
development was about equal.


{Peter} I configured a machine to serve database query results as JSON
objects to the front-end.  This involved modifying the apache
configuration on my machine, writing Python CGI code to pass URL
parameters to Python functions, and wrapping custom SQL queries to the SQLite database
files which were downloaded from the Million Song Dataset website. I
would agree that we contributed equally to this project.  Configuring
Apache and getting a handle on Python and JSON was a bit trickier than
I would have guessed.


To Run:
navigate to: http://patillo.cs.washington.edu/~cse512/

If you want to run it on your own computer you will need to download
the large SQLite database files from
http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset
and put them in the cgi-bin/sqlite/
folder.
